# OpenFiler-NOSSL
This is a mod of Openfiler client without SSL.
I was tired to use Internet Explorer (not more present in Windows 11) to access to the Web GUI since Openfiler was supporting only TLS v1

- Overwrite all files maintaining the same permissions in /opt/openfiler folder
- Reboot OpenFiler
- Now you can access to openfiler with http 

IMPORTANT: due to lack of TLS encryption i strongly advise you to use it only in a test enviroment
